You could even get ideas by walking around your neighborhood with an adult and looking for ways to help. For example; maybe you might see playground equipment that needs to be fixed. Write down all your ideas and put them in your idea bank. These ideas will be waiting for you when you become a Girl Scout Brownie!"
