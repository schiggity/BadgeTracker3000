,Dream Maker Award,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,3,Define the Dream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Together you and the dreamer(s) draft a mission statement that clearly sets out the dream. Then you draw up the steps that will move the dream forward. Coming up with the correct steps will involve a little research! (A mission statement will give the dream vision and focus. Planning out the steps to the dream makes the dream tangible--if you get stuck or a step seems too big; return to the plan! You might have to step it out more; or you may have to change some steps altogether!)
,4,Give It! Gift It!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Help your dreamer(s) take a step forward in the dream plan; and gift the set of stpes for the dream to her. (Taking a step forward will energize your dreamer(s) and start the momentum that will keep the dream progressing! When you are ready to gift the plan; consider making a ceremony of it; perhaps at the journey\'s closing celebration. The plan may serve as a symbolic rememberance of your collaboration on this dream!)
