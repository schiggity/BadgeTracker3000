Meet Successful Dreamers ## Find and then interview three successful women in your community about their dreams and how they have pursued and/or achieved them. (This will show you the path to a successful dream and how dreams get moved forward, even in small ways!) $$
Seek and Select a Dreamer(s) ## Identify a woman or girl (or a group of women and/or girls) who would benefit from your assistance in realizing a dream and who welcomes your assistance. $$
Define the Dream ## Together you and the dreamer(s) draft a mission statement that clearly sets out the dream. Then you draw up the steps that will move the dream forward. Coming up with the correct steps will involve a little research! (A mission statement will give the dream vision and focus. Planning out the steps to the dream makes the dream tangible--if you get stuck or a step seems too big, return to the plan! You might have to step it out more, or you may have to change some steps altogether!) $$$
Give It! Gift It! ## Help your dreamer(s) take a step forward in the dream plan, and gift the set of stpes for the dream to her. (Taking a step forward will energize your dreamer(s) and start the momentum that will keep the dream progressing! When you are ready to gift the plan, consider making a ceremony of it, perhaps at the journey's closing celebration. The plan may serve as a symbolic rememberance of your collaboration on this dream!) $$
