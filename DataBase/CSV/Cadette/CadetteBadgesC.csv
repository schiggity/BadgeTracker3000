,1,Decide what makes a good script,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In this step; think about the movies or television show you love most. Then examine them for clues as to what makes them work.

,,Watch one movie or three shows in ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"Watch one movie or three shows in your favorite genre. (A genre is a category; like adventure; comedy; or drama.) Take notes on how at least three elements; such as the ones mentioned above; make things entertaining. Refer to them for inspiration while working on your own script. FOR MORE FUN: Analyze one movie or three shows you don\'t find entertaining. Looking at what doesn\'t work can be as helpful as concentrating on what does.

,4,Build the plot, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,,You have a story idea and characters. Now you need a plot! A plot is an outline of the situations your protagonist will face. A protagonist\'s circumstances generally grow more dire as the story unfolds toward the climax; where the protagonist faces their most difficult challenge.

,,Collect comic strips from the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"Collect comic strips from the paper for one week. Read them each day paying attention to how all the elements work together. Keep track of what you like and don\'t like; how artists show feelings and actions; and how they work timing to make punch lines great.

Then make up a story with friends. FOR MORE FUN: Draw all nine scenarios and make them tell one story!\"
,2,Choose a story to tell, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,,At heart; comics are another method of storytelling. If you\'ve got comic characters in mind already (people or animals you doodle in notebooks; perhaps?); let those inspire your story. If not; the story you come up with will lead you to your characters. Keep your story simple-it might even be one quick moment! In the next steps; you\'ll turn this story into a four-panel comic.
,,Think of a story from your life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Think of a story from your life. Choose something that happened to you; a friend; or a family member. It could be a funny moment or a dramatic one; a favorite memory or an activity from Girl Scouts you want to share.

,,Make something up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Make something up. Think about the comic books; comic strips; or graphic novels you\'ve liked. Now think of your own made-up story that would make a good comic tale.
,3,Draw it out, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,,Take the characters in your story and start some rough sketching. (You may have only one character; depending on your story.) Stick figures are great! Bring them to life one of these ways.
,,Use tracing paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Use tracing paper. Find a comic strip with a style you love.

,4,Frame it in four panels, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,,It\'s time to put your characters into action; and that means framing them-drawing them in little boxes called panels. So imagine your story as characters in a series of actions. Create panels with sticky notes or by using a ruler to draw them on paper. Tell your story from step 2 by placing your characters into four panels in one of these ways.
,,Use facial expressions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Use facial expressions. Some comics use only faces to illustrate their stories; simply changing the expressions to show emotion and move the story along.
,,Use body postures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Use body postures. For some comic artists-and for some stories-it\'s more about action than emotion. You can leave the faces pretty much the same and move the story along by showing small movements; such as shrugs; and big actions; such as running and leaping.
,,Use both facial expressions and ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Use both facial expressions and body posture. Illustrate movement and emotion using both techniques. Many artists will switch from one style to the other: One panel might show a ball falling on a girl\'s head; and the next panel might show a close-up of her face as she reacts.
,5,Add the words, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,,Yes; there are comics out there with no words; but for the most part the art is a melding of words and pictures meant to be experienced together. Add words to your four-panel comic strip in one of these ways.
,,Add some dialogue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Add some dialogue. If you have more than one character; a classic way to tell your story is through dialogue. If both characters speak in a panel; the one on the left should speak first. Write your character\'s words in oval conversation bubbles connected to the character with a fine line.
,,Add thought bubbles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"Add some thought bubbles. If your story revolves around one character; have her \"\"speak\"\" in thought bubbles; putting her words in ovals connected to her with tiny bubble circles.\"

Use this step to create your own definition using the chart on the next page.
,,Go to a sports event,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Go to a sports event. Take note of as many interactions among athletes; coaches; and officials as you can (arriving early or staying late could help). Emotions and stress can make for more good and bad behavior; so see if you can find an event that\'s part of a championship or longtime rivalry.
,,Watch a sports series,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Watch a sports series. Choose a sport or game you like and pull up an old championship series to watch: the X Games; the Olympics; Wimbledon; the World Series; even a billiards tournament. The beauty of this option is you can watch the replay as often as you like!
,,Head to the Web,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Head to the Web. Read three news stories about good and bad sports behavior. From the triathlete who hopped onto a bus during a race to the home-run hitter who admitted to using steroids; stories of bad behavior abound. Luckily; there are lots of good stories; like when a women\'s college softball team carried an opposing team member around the bases when her knee gave out.
,2,Be a good competitor, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,,You don\'t have to dial it down to be a good sport. In fact; giving it your all in every game or event can be part of good sportsmanship. What else does it take to be a good competitor every time you hit the field or court or track?
,,Make an illustrated quote book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"Make an illustrated quote book. Athletes and coaches share this kind of wisdom all the time (\"\"practice makes perfect;\"\" \"\"if at first you don\'t succeed…\"\").

Play one of these games; then agree on three strategies that helped you build a team and three practices that got in the way.
,,\"Play Trust, like they did on Survivor\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Play Trust; like they did on Survivor. Get a team of at least four girls together and create an obstacle course about 20 yards long.

,4,Psych yourself up, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,,Whether you\'re involved in a team or solo sport; the biggest obstacle can be the voices in your own head. Train those voices; though; and they can be your path to success. Check out the methods sports psychologists and extreme athletes use to psych themselves up for competition and find three that work for you.
,,But I landed my triple axel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,But I landed my triple axel! Judging in sports like figure skating and gymnastics is subjective.

Find an athlete who competes in a subjectively scored sport and see what they have to say.
,,Mind over matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mind over matter. It\'s tough to find an athlete these days; from the oldest skier to the youngest X Games shredder; who doesn\'t talk about visualization.

Find out more about the technique and how it might improve your game.
,,Play sports psychology games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Play sports psychology games. You\'d be surprised how many teams routinely work with sports psychologists.

,5,Put your definition of good, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,,Put your definition of good sportsmanship into action. Consider insights you\'ve gained during steps 2; 3; and 4; and then take a moment to make revisions to the definition you came up with in step 1. Once you\'ve got your ultimate list; put your new ideas and strategies to the test.
,,Compete,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compete. If you\'re already involved in a sport; take your definition and follow it during a big game or event. Or try a new sport.

,,Play with little kids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Play with little kids. Volunteer to help with Little League; to play board games or simple active games (like Red Light; Green Light or Duck; Duck; Goose) at a nursery school; or to run a kindergarten field day. As you teach the kids; you\'ll be testing the strength of your own convictions! After the event; look over your definition. How does it apply to other age groups? Do you need to change anything to make your definition more universal?
,,\"Take on the role of referee, umpire\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"Take on the role of referee; umpire; or judge. Volunteer to work with a league; start an afternoon pickup game; or host a subjective competition (roller skating; figure skating; ballroom dance…).
