,Harvest Award,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,1,Get your leader print going!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"Here\'s the path: Identify; and dig into; a food or land issue; tapping some community experts as you go.
Maybe you\'ve met growers; gardeners; nutrionists or others in your region and have ideas about challenges they face. Maybe you\'ve improved your food print and want to inspire others. Want your school to host a farmers\' market? Got a seed of an idea from this book? Want to team up with other Seniors? Just choose an issue that allows you to use your unique talents and learn something new; too!\"
,2,Capture your vision for change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"in a Harvest Plan that includes: Your very own \"\"So What?\"\"--your goal; why it matters; how it will benefit botht he planet and people. Say it in a way that gets others interested and involved! Show how even simple actions and decisions impact the larger food network. Remember: There\'s no need to do it alone. Who can you turn to for input and support? What specific impact do you hope to have? Name it! And when you have executed your plan; check back. Have you achieved it? Maybe you will have achieved other results; too; especially if you find yourself needing to adjust your plans along the way. Your project can be big or small; dependign on your time and interest. Either way; strive for a sustainable impact. You may push for a new policy or for a change in an existing one. You don\'t need to start something from scratch.\"
,3,\"Now, create change--\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,execute your plan by advocating to influence a food policy or land-use effort (yes; you can!); or by educating and inspiring others to act on a solution you identify.
MISSION: SISTERHOOD!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The Sisterhood Award,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,1,Define a Sisterhood Issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"You\'ve seen a lot of sisterhood issues you can Take Action on. You\'ve read about women and girls who have acted on sisterhood issued important to them. Maybe you tried the Sisterhood Time Capsule or Circle Journal and new issues presented themselves to you. Maybe you\'ve stared to take notice of issues around you; in your own life; and in your community; too. So; it\'s time to grab your sisterhood issue! What might it be? As you weigh your options; keep in mind that a great Sisterhood Project gives you the opportunity to:   find and think about a sisterhood issue you\'ve never thought about before   figure out what youc an do about a sisterhood issue you care about   meet and talk to new people (which expands your sisterhood!)   understand how to focus your efforts so you get results despite whatever time and resource obstacles you might face   start some change that keeps on going even after you\'re done   step back and say; \"\"I made this change happen!\"\"   be a true example of sisterhood in action!\" 
,2,Develop Your Mission!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"Decide on the results you want to see.   The specific results I will aim for are:   To get these results; I will need to talk to and involve these people:   I will also need to do some research about these things:  Now that you know your issue and what you hope to accomplish; create a commercial for your issue. If you have only 30 seconds to expalin your issue; why it matters; and what you\'re going to do about it; what would you say? That\'s Your Mission.\"
,3,Make the Big Decisions!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"Now that you have a mission; you need to get specific about how and for whom you will carry it out. Who will you educate and inspire? Or who will you advocate for? What will you educate and inspire others about? These decisions are the beginning of your Sisterhood Project plan! It may be that by focusing in on one aspect of your issue; you\'ll get greater results than if you go big and broad with your efforts. Think of a snowball--what change do you want to put in motion; and how can you involve others so that this change grows and grows? Use the questions and the space in this planner to start creating your own sisterhood spiral!\"
,4,Logistics Time!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"Consider each of the following: The scope of your project: How many people are you reaching out to? Are they local; nationwide; or abroad?  Your resources: What people; supplies; money; and in-kind donations will you need? Do you have a budget? Will there be any costs to cover? Even fliers cost money! How can you keep costs down or eliminate them entirely? Who can you ask for donations? PR/marketing: You might ask a public realtions expert for tips on...  creating fliers that explain why your issue is important   writing a pitch letter to a radio or TV news station about your project Engage as many people as possible; as either mentors or volunteers. Depending on the topic of your project; you might:   Talk to a psychologist; social worker; or counselor about how to write girl-to-girl mentorship questions; and ask for their assistance checking facts for any informational fliers you might create.   Ask girls with healthy friendship and sisterood values/skills to voluneer as mentors.   Ask a graphic designer for advice on attention-grabbing fliers.   Ask teachers if you can receive school credit for any aspects of your project. Perhaps a math teacher can assist with statistics or an English teacher can help you write the fliers?   Talk to students interested in filmmaking to see if they would create a mini documentary on your project; which you can then use to promote your project and expand its reach.\"
